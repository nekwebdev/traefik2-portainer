# Portainer behind a hardened Traefik2 Proxy
Traefik2 setup to run as a non root user behind [Tecnativa](https://github.com/Tecnativa)/**[docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy)** to access the docker socket. Most of the Traefik2 configuration is from [wollomatic](https://github.com/wollomatic)/**[traefik2-hardened](https://github.com/wollomatic/traefik2-hardened)**.
Using [containrrr](https://github.com/containrrr)/**[watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower)** to keep containers updated and [thomseddon](https://github.com/thomseddon)/**[traefik-forward-auth](https://github.com/thomseddon/traefik-forward-auth)** for oauth.

## Initial setup

### DNS setup
Traefik2 will be using the TLS challenge so you can not use wildcards and need a CNAME entry for all of your subdomains.

### Setup Docker log rotation
Add the following values in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Create this file if it doesnâ€™t exist. Adjust the values to fit.
```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "10"
  }
}
```
Then reload the config and restart docker.
```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
### Create Traefik2 user
Create a user named `traefik` with an id of `2000`, no home folder and no shell to prevent any login.
```shell
sudo useradd -u 2000 -M -s /usr/sbin/nologin traefik
```
### Create Traefik2 proxy network
We want to manually create this network. Now is a good time to add your admin user to the `docker` group so you do not have to use `sudo` for docker commands.
```shell
docker network create traefik-servicenet
```
### Setup .env and htpasswd files
***.env file:***
- Set the correct values in `.env.example`, use `openssl rand -hex 16` to generate `SECRET` for google oauth.
- [Create a new Google Project](https://console.developers.google.com/) to use the google oauth and get the `PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `PROVIDERS_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- Rename it to `.env` and change it's permissions `chmod 600 .env`

***htpasswd file:***

The `docker-compose.yaml` and `./traefik/dynamic/middlewares.yaml` expect a `htpasswd` file even if you do not plan on using the `basicAuth@file` middleware and use `traefikOauth@file` instead.
- Rename `./traefik/htpasswd.example` to `./traefik/htpasswd`
- Change it's permissions and ownership, change `admin` to your username.
```
chmod 640 ./traefik/htpasswd
sudo chown admin:traefik ./traefik/htpasswd
```
- Generate a htpasswd string using Bcrypt mode at https://hostingcanada.org/htpasswd-generator/ and replace the dummy string in `./traefik/htpasswd` with this one. You can skip this and leave the dummy one if you do not plan on using `basicAuth@file`.

### Create acme.json file
Docker can not create new files to be mounted so we do it before hand and give it the proper ownership and permissions.
```shell
touch ./traefik/acme.json
chmod 600 ./traefik/acme.json
sudo chown traefik:traefik ./traefik/acme.json
```

## Post setup notes
In traefik2 static config file `./traefik/traefik.yaml` comment out the `caServer` line in the `certificatesResolvers` once tests are done to stop using Let's Encrypt staging server. You will also want to set the log level back to `WARN` in that same file.
***TIP:*** when using the staging server chrome base browsers will complain about SSL and rightly so, click the show advanced info button and if you have no options to ignore and proceed, just type in the browser window `thisisunsafe` and it will load your service.
